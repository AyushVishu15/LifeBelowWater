            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Starfish and brittle stars belong to the echinoderm crown-group, which also includes sea urchins, sea cucumbers, and Crinoidea (sea lilies and feather stars). The ancient species C. fezouataensis, which has a similar arm structure to modern-day sea lilies, first appeared during the great Ordovician biodiversification event. This period marked a significant increase in the diversity of life. The discovery of C. fezouataensis helps link starfish-like animals from about 480 million years ago to more recent fossils and modern animals. The researchers aren't sure what C. fezouataensis ate, but evidence of a jaw suggests it was likely not a filter feeder like some anomalocaridids and modern brittle stars.

              <br><br>  Paleontologist Bertrand Lefebvre highlighted the importance of this new early starfish from Morocco in understanding early asterozoan evolution and the origins of the echinoderm crown-group. To uncover its ancestry, the research team meticulously analyzed each feature of the fossil and compared them with those of living animals and known fossils. They employed both biological analysis and a mathematical algorithm to place these ancient starfish ancestors on a family tree. However, Lefebvre noted that more research is needed, particularly on animals from the late Cambrian period (497 million to 485.4 million years ago), to bridge the gap between the earliest echinoderms and the five groups we see today.<br><br><br></p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Feathery soft corals make up this bouquet of brightly-colored sea life. Soft coral are members of the Octocorallia subclass, named for their "eightfold radial symmetry," which means they have eight smaller pieces that branch off of each main tube to give the downy appearance. 
            Soft coral, which have significant variation in shape and size, can thrive in deep water or shallow tropical water.<br><br><br></p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Kelp is especially stunning when seen from below because it can look just like lush, leafy woodland. Nutrient-rich kelp may show up on the beach as torn piles of seaweed, but underwater it has a whole different life. A type of brown algae, this plant can grow up to 18 inches per day and can reach depths of up to 131 feet—hence why their habitats are called kelp forests.

                When scientists stumbled upon a kelp forest in the Pacific Ocean in 2007, the discovery highlighted how much we still have to learn about the world's waters. Prior to this discovery, biologists thought kelp could not grow in warm tropical waters.<br><br><br></p>

With bodies made up of 95% water, these delicate creatures must rely on thousands of venom- containing stinging cells called cnidocytes for protection and prey capture.
             The largest species of jellyfish has tentacles that can reach more than 100 feet long- longer than a blue whale.<br><br><br></p>

                       This columnal plant can grow as tall as three feet and thrives in cold water from Alaska to San Diego. And while the soft pouf at the top looks like a nice place for a fish nap, those tentacles are the anemone's primary tool for stinging and catching prey.<br><br><br></p>
